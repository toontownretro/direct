    DO lifetime

    In order to implement distributed objects, we need to have:
    A generate message - gets sent to all clients in the world when an object
                         comes into existance
    Event messages - when something interesting happens to the object
    Update messages - when something intersting changes on the object
    A delete message - when the object goes away

    __init__():
    Brand new object is being constructed but isn't "alive" yet

    generate():
    Brand new object is now alive but does not have a known initial state

    announceGenerate(): client only
    Object has a known initial state and is now fully alive... OR the object
    was temporarily disabled/cached away and is coming back. Start things like
    tasks, event listeners, and add the object into the scene graph.

    disable(): client only
    Object is being temporarily removed/cached away to quickly bring it back
    when requested. Clean up all logical things like tasks, event listeners,
    and remove it from the scene graph.. but don't delete nodes/data from memory.

    delete():
    Object is going away completely, should tear down everything created in
    generate() and __init__() expecting the object to never come back.
