/**
 * This class holds the last tick that each state field in a distributed object
 * changed at.
 *
 * It provides fast access to a list of fields that changed within a certain
 * frame range.
 *
 * These are created once per object per frame. Since usually a very small
 * percentage of an object's fields actually change each frame, this allows you
 * to get a small set of fields to delta for each client.
